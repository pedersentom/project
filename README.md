This project was part of a course in Statistical Data Processing at Stockholm University. I had the opportunity to choose a subject I liked as long as most coding, analysis, and visualizations were done in R. This required a lot of creativity and planning.

This project aimed to work with many data types from several sources and gain insights using creative graphing techniques. The goal was to visualize relative sentiment changes based on Twitter data containing tweets about companies listed on the stock market. The result shows that it is conceptually possible to compute, aggregate, and visualize stock sentiment using tweets, but there are many challenges in getting accurate results.
